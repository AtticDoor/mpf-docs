# Machine config files


Some config sections can only be used in your machine-wide configs.
Others can only exist in [Mode config files](mode_config.md) or some in either of them. Those are usually hardware
related and/or exist outside of the game. You can see if this is the
case at the top of the relevant
[config](../index.md) section. For
instance [lights](../lights.md) are
defined machine-wide because they are used throughout the whole
lifecycle of a machine.
