# Adding widgets to a slide


Now that you know what widgets are, it's time to look at how you can
actually use them.

## Option 1. Define widgets when you define a slide

The easiest way to create and use widgets is to include them in the
slide configuration when the slide itself is created.

You can do this when you define a slide in the `slides:` section of your
config, or when you show a slide in the `slide_player:` section of your
config. See the [How to create slides](../slides/creating_slides.md) guide for details.

## Option 2. Use the "widget player"

If you want to add a widget (or a groups of widgets) to an existing
slide, you can use the [widget_player:](../../config/widget_player.md). You can define your widgets there, or you can use widgets
that you've [pre-defined](reusable_widgets.md).
