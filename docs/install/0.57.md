# MPF 0.57 plans & timeline (last updated August 7, 2023)

MPF 0.57 is being worked on now. It is not ready for testing yet, but we wanted to give you a heads up on what to expect.
We estimate MPF 0.57 will be ready for testing in the late August 2023 timeframe.

If you want to track the progress, the 0.57 working fork is here: [github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/0.57](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/0.57)

## Big changes in 0.57

* Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11
* Remove support for Python 3.7
* Changes the YAML interface to remove "hacks" we added years ago. Now MPF supports pure YAML with no customizations.
* Removed the config file migrator (hasn't been used in years)

## What about MPF-MC?

MPF required lots of internal engineering to support Python 3.10+ and pure YAML. MPF-MC will need that same work. The plan is to get MPF 0.57 to a good state, and then to start working on MPF-MC 0.57. This means there will be a delay between MPF 0.57 and MPF-MC 0.57. Hopefully that's only a few weeks or a month, but since MPF-MC is much more complicated than MPF, it could take longer.

All this work is being done by one person (by me, Brian, hello!) If you want to help, please reach out to brian@fastpinball.com. Thanks!

## Upgrading to MPF 0.57

Here's what it will take to upgrade to MPF 0.57:

* If you're on Python 3.7, you'll need to update.
* If you're on Python 3.8 or 3.9, you do not have to change your Python version.
* If you want, you can use Python 3.10 or 3.11.
* Update your config files to config_version 6

## YAML changes in MPF 0.57 / config version 6

Since MPF 0.57 removes the older YAML hacks we did years ago, you will need to update your config files. Because this is a config file change, MPF 0.57 moves from `config_version=5` to `config_version=6`.

The full guide to how to update your config files is [here](../config/instructions/config_v6.md)
