# Installing MPF


The MPF Installers were rewritten from scratch and completely updated
for MPF 0.56 in August 2022. (If you're using an older version of MPF,
see the docs for the version you're using for installation
instructions.)

MPF should work with following platforms:

* Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit only)
* macOS 10.14+, up through macOS 13 Ventura (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* Linux (64-bit, lots of distros)
* Raspberry Pi 4B (eventually, not done yet, but no one can get Pis
    now anyway so no hurry.)

Python 3.9 is the latest version of Python supported. Some platforms
also support Python 3.7 and 3.8. Python 3.10+ will not work.

Here links to the installation guides for each platform:

* [Mac](mac.md)
* [Windows](windows.md)
* [Linux](linux)
