# Installing MPF


The MPF Installers were rewritten from scratch and completely updated
for MPF 0.56 in August 2022. (If you're using an older version of MPF,
see the [docs for the version you're using](../versions/docs.md) for installation
instructions.)

MPF should work with following platforms:

* Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit only)
* macOS 10.14+, up through macOS 13 Ventura (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* Linux (64-bit, lots of distros)
* Raspberry Pi

Python 3.9 is the latest version of Python supported. Some platforms
also support Python 3.7 and 3.8. Python 3.10+ will not work.

!!! note "MPF 0.57 will support Python 3.10 & 3.11"

    MPF 0.57, which is in progress now and should be available for testing
    somewhere in the Aug/Sept 2023 timeframe will drop support for Python 3.7
    and add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11. See our [0.57 page](0.57.md) for details.

Here links to the installation guides for each platform:

* [Mac](mac.md)
* [Windows](windows.md)
* [Linux](linux)
