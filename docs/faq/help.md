# FAQ: Getting help


## Where can I go for help?

Check the [Community](../community/index.md) page for links to forums and events.

## I think I've found a bug. Now what?

Post it to the "issues" section of that repo on GitHub:

* [MPF Issues](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/issues)
* [MPF-MC Issues](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/issues)
* [MPF Monitor Issues](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-monitor/issues)
* [MPF Website / Documentation Issues](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-docs/issues)

## I want MPF to work with a new piece of hardware

Awesome! We've designed MPF to be platform-independent, meaning that
the core MPF software doesn't talk to hardware directly. Instead we
have "platform interfaces" for different types of hardware.

The easiest way to understand how these work is to look through the code
for the existing platform interfaces. This code is in the [platforms
folder in
MPF](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/dev/mpf/platforms).

As always, if you have questions, please post them to the
[Mission Pinball discussion group on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/missionpinball/discussions).
