# Game Variables


Game variables are variables built-in as part of the core MPF code. These variables are available to you to query specifics while a game is in play.

Like player and machine variables, you can use the game variables in
your config files and can be particularly useful for conditional
arguments. Unlike player and machine variables you cannot define new game variables in your config file.

* [max_players](max_players.md)
* [num_players](num_players.md)
* [balls_per_game](balls_per_game.md)
* [balls_in_play](balls_in_play.md)
* [tilted](tilted.md)
* [slam_tilted](slam_tilted.md)
