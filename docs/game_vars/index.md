# Game Variables


Game variables allow you to query specifics while a game is in play.

Like player and machine variables, you can use the game variables in
your config files and can be particularly useful for conditional
arguments.

* [max_players](max_players.md)
* [num_players](num_players.md)
* [balls_per_game](balls_per_game.md)
* [balls_in_play](balls_in_play.md)
* [tilted](tilted.md)
* [slam_tilted](slam_tilted.md)
