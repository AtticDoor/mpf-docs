# (logic_block)_state:

--8<-- "player_var.md"

A dictionary that stores the internal state of the logic block with the
name (logic_block). (In other words, a logic block called
*mode1_hit_counter* will store its state in a player variable called
`mode1_hit_counter_state`).

The state that's stored in this variable include whether the logic
block is enabled and whether it's complete.
