# Common Issues


We try to answer some common questions regarding logic blocks here. If
you question is not answered please ask in the forum.

## My block only works once. Why?

This is the default configuration of all logic blocks. To change it you
first need to set `reset_on_complete` to `True`. As a result you blocks
will reset when they reach the final step. However, that will not be
enough in most cases because `disable_on_complete` is `True` by default.
Unless you have some enable logic to re-enable the block later, you
probably want to set `disable_on_complete` to `False`.

## When should I used logic blocks and when should I use shots/show_groups?

There is no definitive answer to this question. Generally, it depends on
your usecase. Shots and shot_groups serve a very specific usecase.
Basically, they implement a sequences of switch hits which trigger
lights along the way. If you want to stay within that specific usecase
then go with shots because it will be more convenient. If you plan to
extend your mode to use more advanced features then go with logic
blocks. For instance if you got conditions in your logic (i.e. on how
many balls are locked). Another clear indicator for logic blocks would
be if your logic is triggered by other elements such as locks (and not
just switches).
