title: Holopin, built with MPF
---

<!-- This file is used as the template for all the individual project pages. -->

!!! note "This page was autogenerated. (And temporary!)"

    For a few years, people have been contributing information about their pinball
    projects built using MPF. All of that information is in the `/projects` folder
    in the root of the repo.

    Since we just did the website migration, we still need to make these project
    pages look nice. We'll probably get to it soon, or, you can help us out and
    submit a PR to make this page look better. :) Edit the
    `/docs/projects/_project_template.md` file to change the layout of this page.
