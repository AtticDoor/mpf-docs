# Installing MPF Monitor


The current stable version of MPF Monitor is `0.56` which matches the stable versions of MPF and MPF-MC.
You can install it via `pip` (or `pip3`, or however you installed MPF).

``` doscon
pip install mpf-monitor
```

The dev branch of MPF Monitor has been updated for MPF 0.57. You can install it by adding the `--pre` flag:

``` doscon
pip install mpf-monitor --pre
```
