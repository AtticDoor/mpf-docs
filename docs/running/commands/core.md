# mpf core (command-line utility)


Runs the MPF "core" modules without any game logic. This feature has
not been fully implemented yet, but it's being put in place to
facilitate using the MPF platform interface to be completely controlled
by external sources such as PinMAME without any of MPF's game logic.
