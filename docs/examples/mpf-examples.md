# Did you know there's a GitHub repo of MPF Example games?

One of the GitHub repos that's part of Mission Pinball is called
[mpf-examples](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples) which
contains a few different example MPF configs and some templates you can
use.

!!! note "This repo needs to be updated"

    As of this writing (June 2023), the mpf-examples repo is a bit out
    of date. We would love some help to update it. Nothing is super
    broken, but there are probably some simple config file changes or
    updates that are needed before the examples work with the latest
    versions of MPF.

The mpf-examples repo doesn't have an installer, rather, you just
download it and unzip it and start using the stuff it contains.

Each software repo in GitHub has several "branches". (Think of
branches kind of like versions.) The mpf-examples repo has multiple
branches that each match a specific version of MPF. For example, the
0.21 branch of the mpf-examples repo is for MPF 0.21, the 0.30 branch is
for MPF 0.30, etc.

Unzip the file to any location you want, and then browse the files to
see what's there, or open a console window to launch MPF and/or MPF MC
in each folder.

`demo_man`

Williams Demolition Man. This config is pretty basic, but you can play
complete games and it has some simple shots, scoring, and modes. It
also contains custom code to run the Cryro Claw. See details which
explain how to "play" this game on your computer
[here](demo_man.md).

`mc_demo`

A machine config that demonstrates several capabilities of the MPF
Media Controller (MPF-MC). Details [here](mc_demo.md).

`tutorial` (and several `tutorial_step_XX` folders)

Contains the config files used in the [MPF Tutorial](../tutorial/index.md).

`wpc_template`

A template config you can use for WPC machines.
