# Example Configuration Files


MPF is very complex with lots of modules and options. In order to make
sure that everything works, we have over 700 automated tests that run
every time we add or change something in MPF in order to make sure we
didn't break something.

All of these automated tests include config files (machine configs, mode
configs, and show files). In many ways, these config files are the
"ultimate truth" when it comes to what configs actually work with MPF.

All of the links below show the actual config files (pulled from the MPF
and MPF-MC packages) that are used to test MPF. They're also a valuable
resource for people creating games with MPF since they show many
different options and configurations that are known to work.
