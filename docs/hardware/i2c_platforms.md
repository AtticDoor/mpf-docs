# I2C Platforms in MPF


The following platforms allow controlling I2C devices in MPF:

* [Linux Nativ I2C](smbus.md) - If your linux PC has a driver for the I2C interface it will work in MPF
* [P3-ROC](multimorphic/index.md) - (but not the P-Roc)
* [Raspberry Pi](rpi.md) - Remote via network or locally using pigpio

The following platforms need to be interfaced by one of the above
platforms: \*
[PCA9685/PCA9635 I2C Servo Controllers](i2c_servo.md) \*
[MMA8451 Accelerometers](mma8451.md)
