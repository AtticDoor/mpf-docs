# How to install P-ROC / P3-ROC drivers on Linux


If you want to use MPF on a Debian-based version of Linux (which
includes Ubuntu), you can use our all-in-one Debian installer which is
detailed in the [platform](../../install/linux/index.md)
guide.

Note that when you run that installation script, it will ask you what
type of hardware you'll be using. If you choose the "P3 or P-ROC"
option, then it will install all of the libraries and drivers you need,
and everything should work.

After that, you can continue on with the [How to configure MPF for the P-ROC/P3-ROC platform](platform.md) documentation to finish your MPF configuration for the
P-ROC/P3-ROC.

## What if it did not work?

MPF is erroring out on start-up? Cannot connect to your P/P3-Roc? Have a
look at the
[troubleshooting guide for P/P3-Roc](../../troubleshooting/index.md).
