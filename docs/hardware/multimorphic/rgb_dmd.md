# How to configure an RGB DMD (P-ROC/P3_ROC)

Neither the P-ROC nor the P3-ROC has direct support for RGB DMDs.
However you can still use an RGB DMD with a P-ROC/P3-ROC by using one of
the standalone RGB DMD controllers. (Basically you buy the RGB DMD
hardware and another small controller, and then you have two USB
connections from your computer---one to the P-ROC/P3-ROC, and a second
to the RGB DMD controller.)

Standalone RGB DMD options which you can use with a P-ROC/P3-ROC
include:

* [SmartMatrix](../smartmatrix.md)
* [RGB.DMD](../eli_dmd.md)
