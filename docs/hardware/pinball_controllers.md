# What's a pinball controller?

A pinball controller is a hardware circuit board that connects a real
pinball machine to your computer via USB, allowing your computer to
control a pinball machine. People use pinball controllers to build their
own pinball machines, or to write their own rules for existing classic
pinball machines.
