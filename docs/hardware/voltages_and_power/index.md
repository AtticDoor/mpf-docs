# Voltages and Power in Pinball Machines

This section is about some general electric details in pinball machines.

FAST Pinball has full wiring guides for pinball machines built on their
platforms. It is very comprehensive and covers all aspects of wiring. Even
if you're not using FAST Pinball hardware, it's a great resource to learn
about wiring & safety in pinball machines. (All of their wiring guides aim
to teach people how to build machines that would pass UL listing, FCC, and
CE certifications.)
