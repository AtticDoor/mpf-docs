# Using MPF with Hobbyist Maker Hardware

There are lots of hardware boards from places like Adafruit, Sparkfun, AliExpress, and others that are great for hobbyists and makers. MPF supports many of these boards, and this page will help you get started.

These boards are not designed for pinball machines, and most of them are not
appropriate for commercial machines (do to their lack of protections, no focus
on UL listing or EMI compliance, etc.). However they're great for homebrew
machines, and they're also great for learning and prototyping.
