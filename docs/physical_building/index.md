# How To Build Physical Pinball Machines


This chapter is about building physical pinball machines. If you plan to
build a homebrew machine read this section and you might be able to skip
some mistakes which have been made by others before. We try to cover
most of the building part here. A few things are elsewhere, notably
[Pinball Controll Systems](../hardware/index.md) and [Pinball Mechs](../mechs/index.md).

Where should you start? If you want to create a custom layout read our
[guide on layout considerations](layout_considerations.md).
