# Controlling Data East Machines


Data east machines can be controlled using the
[SNUX System 11 board](../hardware/snux.md) connected to any [WPC controller](wpc.md) such as the
[Multimorphic P-ROC](../hardware/multimorphic/index.md) (not the P3-ROC). This is similar to
[Controlling Williams, Bally System 11 Machines](system11.md).

More technical information can be found in the [PinWiki Data
East/Sega](http://www.pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Data_East/Sega)
page.
