# Controlling Williams, Bally System 11 Machines


You can connect your machine using the
[SNUX System 11 board](../hardware/snux.md) to any [WPC controller](wpc.md)
such as the
[Multimorphic P-ROC](../hardware/multimorphic/index.md) (not the P3-ROC). This solution requires the existing driver
boards.

Another option is to use the
[Arduino Pinball Controller (APC)](../hardware/apc/index.md) which also replaces the original driver board. Nothing
except the APC board is needed to control the machine using MPF. This
can be optionally used together with
[LISY](../hardware/lisy/index.md) to emulate
the original ROM.

More technical information can be found in the [PinWiki Williams System
9 and
11](http://www.pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Williams_System_9_-_11)
page.
