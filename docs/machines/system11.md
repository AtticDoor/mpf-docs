# Controlling Williams, Bally System 11 Machines

FAST Pinball has a drop-in [System 11 Retro Controller](https://fastpinball.com/retro/) which lets you control
a System 11 machine via MPF as well as play the original game via onboard
ROMs.

Another option is the [Multimorphic P-ROC](../hardware/multimorphic/index.md) (not the P3-ROC) with
the [SNUX System 11 board](../hardware/snux.md).

Another option is to use the [Arduino Pinball Controller (APC)](../hardware/apc/index.md) which also replaces the original driver board. Nothing except the APC board is needed to control the machine using MPF. This
can be optionally used together with [LISY](../hardware/lisy/index.md) to emulate the original ROM.

More technical information can be found in the [PinWiki Williams System 9 and 11](http://www.pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Williams_System_9_-_11) page.
