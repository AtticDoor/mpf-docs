# Controlling a custom "homebrew" machine with MPF


Details for how to build custom machine hardware are covered on the
[PinballMakers.com Wiki](http://pinballmakers.com). We cover some
general areas here and suggest that you investigate those on your own.
Contributions to the guide (and the rest of the documentation are
[welcome](../about/help_docs.md)).

## Control System

If you want to use MPF
to power a new *custom* pinball machine that you build yourself, you
should buy new custom driver boards. There are a few common choices:

* [FAST Pinball](../hardware/fast/index.md)
* [CobraPin Pinball Controller](../hardware/opp/cobrapin/index.md)
* [Multimorphic P3-Roc](../hardware/multimorphic/index.md)
* [Open Pinball Project (OPP)](../hardware/opp/index.md)
* [LISY Home (custom pinball version of LISY)](../hardware/lisy/index.md)
* [Arduino Pinball Controller](../hardware/apc/index.md)

FAST and Multimorphic are both commercial systems. OPP is an open
source/open hardware project which is cheaper to buy, but barebones
and requires some time and skill. CobraPin is based on OPP with the
goal of making OPP more accessible and provides somewhat of an
all-in-one solution.

You might also want to some more control boards for servos, steppers and
light. Common choices are:

* [Fadecandy](../hardware/fadecandy/index.md) for WS2812 lights (FAST and P3-Roc offer this too)
* [Pololu Maestro](../hardware/pololu_maestro.md) for servos

See the [Hardware Section](../hardware/index.md) for all hardware supported by MPF.

## Power and Wiring

You should invest some time into at the beginning of your custom pinball
journey into your power supply and wiring.

* [Voltages and Power](../hardware/voltages_and_power/voltages_and_power.md)
* [Wiring and Connectors in Pinball Machines](../hardware/voltages_and_power/wiring_and_connectors.md)

## Parts and Assemblies

MPF supports a
[varity of pinball mechs](../mechs/index.md).
You can have a look at manuals of existing machines to find numbers of
mechs. For homebrew machines it is wise to buy assemblies of mechs.
Mostly, because mechs consist of a lot of parts and you will likely fail
to order all of them at once. Additionally, assemblies are often
cheaper.

There are a few shops such as
[Pinballlife](https://www.pinballlife.com/) which offer assemblies. They
also have a homebrew section which is worth checking out. Other shops
such as [Marcos Specialities](https://www.marcospecialties.com/) offer
more parts but are less focused on homebrew.
