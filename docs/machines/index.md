# Compatible Pinball Machines


If you haven't done so already, be sure to read the
[MPF overview: How MPF works](../start/index.md) page to understand how MPF
talks to physical pinball machines.

There are three options when it comes to using MPF with a pinball
machine:

* Build your own new machine completely from scratch.
* Rewrite the rules for an existing machine, which means you don't
    change the physical hardware at all, rather, you just update the
    software.
* "Retheme" an existing machine, which means you reuse all of the
    mechanical and electrical components of an existing machine, but you
    strip down and replace all the artwork to transform it into
    something else. (And you rewrite all the rules for your new theme.)

Here are more details on each option. The "rewrite the rules" and
"retheme" options above are combined below into the "controlling an
existing machine" section:

* [homebrew](homebrew.md)
* [existing](existing.md)
