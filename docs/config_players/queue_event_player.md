# Queue Event player


The *queue event player* is a
[config player](index.md)
that's used to play queue events.

Video about events in MPF:

</div>

## Usage in config files

In config files, the event player is used via the `queue_event_player:`
section.

## Usage in shows

None. (It's not valid in shows since it doesn't make sense in shows.)

## Config Options

See [queue_event_player:](../config/queue_event_player.md) for
config details.
