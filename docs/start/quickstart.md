# Quickstart guide to MPF

This is for people who know what they're doing. If you're lost, check out our full
[installation guides](../install/index.md).

1. MPF requires Python 3.7 - 3.9. Newer than 3.9 won't work.

2. `pip install mpf`

3. `pip install mpf-monitor`

4. Create a folder for your machine config files as outlined in the [tutorial](../tutorial/index.md).

We do not recommend installing the Media Controller right away since it's more of a pain to get installed, and
you don't need it yet.
