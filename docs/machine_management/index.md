# Machine Management


MPF includes many features to help you manage your pinball machine.

(There's a lot to add here. This will include things like the service
mode, auditor, remote monitoring and trouble reporting, etc. See:
[Help us to write it](../about/help.md))

!!! warning

    If the `service` mode is added to `modes`, the message "coil power
    off" will appear when the coin door is open. With most control systems,
    this is only a message. (Unless you're using FAST Pinball's smart power
    filter board which allows MPF to control the 48V circuit.)
    You must ensure that your power system is wired appropriately to turn
    high voltage off when the coin door is open.
