Proximity switches operate via the interaction of the ball within a
magnetic field created by the switch. Unlike a reed switch, which also
uses a magnetic field to sense the ball, proximity switches differ in
that they do not have any moving parts. However, a voltage must be
applied and they require additional circuitry compared to a reed switch.
Alien pinball (heighway Pinball, 2017) makes signifigant use of
proximity switches in liu of the traditional thru-playfield mechanical
leaf-blade style switches. An advantage of proximity switches (other
than not needing to make thru-playfield cuts or have mechanical parts
wear out), is that they can be designed with different levels of
sensitivity, or even made tunable.

For homebrew pinball applications, while they are not typically
available from major pinball suppliers due to their scarcity in current
and past pinballs, there are a few online sources of these switches --
including the exact ones used in Alien Pinball.

Wiring will depend on the exact switch used. With SW-16 switch boards,
the use of pull-up resistors will likely be required when supplying a
direct input to the switch ports. FAST boards should work similarily.
