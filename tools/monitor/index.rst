The MPF Monitor
===============

The MPF monitor is a graphical app that connects to a live running instance of
MPF and shows the status of various devices. (LEDs, switches, ball locks, etc.)
as well as a running list of recent :doc:`MPF events </events/index>`.
You can add a picture of your playfield and drag-and-drop devices to their
proper locations so you can interact with your machine when you're not near
your physical machine and/or for developing your game. MPF Monitor is also
great when you have more than one person working on your MPF code but your
physical machine is at one person's house. :)

The MPF Monitor can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It uses
`PyQt6 <https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_ (Python
bindings for Qt6) for its visual framework.

Here's a screen shot of it in action:

.. note::

   The MPF Monitor is *not* a full pinball simulation with physics or moving
   balls or anything. But it does enough that you can use it to do real work
   on a machine when that machine is not nearby.

Features
--------

* Connects to a live running instance of MPF.
* Automatically discovers all the pinball mechs and devices in the game.
* Device state is updated in real time in the "Devices" window.
* MPF events and their keyword arguments are posted in real time to "Events"
  window.
* You can add a photo of your playfield and then drag-and-drop LEDs, lights,
  and switches from the device tree onto the playfield.

      * LEDs (circle icons) show their color in real time.
      * Lights (circle icons) show their brightness in real time between black
        and white.
      * Switches (square icons) show their state (green = active, black =
        inactive).
      * More device types will become "draggable" in the future.

* Left-click on a switch to "tap" it (activate & release). Right-click on a
  switch to "toggle" it (change its state and hold it).
* Devices added to the playfield image are saved & restored when you restart
  the monitor.
* Window sizes, positions, and which windows are open are remembered and
  restored on next use.
* You can start the monitor and leave it running, and it will automatically
  connect (and disconnect/reconnect) to MPF as MPF starts and stops.

Road Map Features
-----------------

MPF Monitor is *very* rough at this point. (Really more of a proof-of-concept.)
We plan to add more features, including:

* More details for events, including listing registered handlers & making it so
  you can sort, search, and clear the list.
* Adding all the "game logic" stuff, including modes, shots, shot groups, shot
  profiles, logic blocks, timers, ball locks, multiballs, achievements, etc.
* Add shows (running shows, step they're on, priority, etc.)
* Add players information (show all player variables and their values)
* A "snapshot" button that can dump the entire current state to a file
  for debugging later
* Export position (x/y) settings of widgets back to the MPF config
* Connect to MPF-MC to get information about slides, displays, widgets, etc.
* Add color controls to the playfield image to set brightness and color
  saturation
* Add buttons to enable/disable different types of devices (think of it like
  "layers" for the playfield image.
* Show additional properties from the selected device (Click a device to see
  it's full information.)
* Change debug levels of various devices dynamically
* Save the config / layout with a specified file name
* Add multiple playfield views which could each have different devices
* Set colors, shapes, rotation, & sizes of devices (so inserts can be the
  right shape). Allow configurable "off" colors which can include opacity
  and "glow" so inserts look like real lights.
* Allow all devices to be added to the playfield image, with custom
  representation (diverters that animate, flippers that animate, etc.).
* Device state change history that shows what properties changed and when.
* Default (mostly blank) playfield image if no playfield image is specified
* Configurable default options (folder location, playfield image name, etc.)
