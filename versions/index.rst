MPF Versions
============

MPF is a work-in-progress. New versions are released every so often. You can find your MPF version by running `mpf --version` from the command line.

If you're looking for a specific version of the documentation to match the older version of
MPF you're using, look in the "Assets" link at the bottom of the release notes for any version
in the `MPF releases page on GitHub <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/releases>`_.
