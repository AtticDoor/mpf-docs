!!! info "This section is maintained by the hardware maker"

    This section of the MPF website is about a specific company's
    pinball controller hardware, and they are responsible for
    maintaining the content here.

    Of course feel free to edit, add, and/or correct things if you
    want, but if something seems weird, reach out to the hardware
    maker, not the MPF maintainers. ;)
