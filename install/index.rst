Downloading & Installing MPF (2023 Version)
================================================

The MPF Installers were rewritten from scratch and completely updated for MPF 0.56 in August 2022.
(If you're using an older version of MPF, see the docs for the version you're using for installation instructions.)

MPF should work with following platforms:

* Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit only)
* macOS 10.14+, up through macOS 13 Ventura (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* Linux (64-bit, lots of distros)
* Raspberry Pi 4B (eventually, not done yet, but no one can get Pis now anyway so no hurry.)

Python 3.9 is the latest version of Python supported. Some platforms also support Python 3.7 and 3.8. Python 3.10+ will not work.

Here links to the installation guides for each platform:

Install MPF Monitor
-------------------

One you install MPF, you should install the MPF Monitor. This is a tool that allows you to monitor and interact with your game while MPF is running. It's very useful, especially for working on MPF without a physical machine.
