Downloading & Installing MPF (Aug 29, 2022 update)
==================================================

The MPF Installers have been rewritten from scratch in August 2022 and
are completely updated for MPF 0.56 (the current "dev" version that will be released once
we get these installer built).

We are currently targeting the following platforms:

* Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit only)
* macOS 10.14+, including macOS 12 Monterey (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* Linux (64-bit, lots of distros)
* Raspberry Pi 4B (eventually, not done yet, but no one can get Pis now anyway so no hurry.)

We are targeting Python 3.9. Python 3.10 will definitely not work yet. Python 3.7 and 3.8
are also supported on most platforms.

Here are the links to the guides we have started so far:
