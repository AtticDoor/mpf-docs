Downloading & Installing MPF (Aug 11, 2022 update)
=================================================

The MPF Installers are being rewritten from scratch and will be completely
updated for MPF 0.56 (the current "dev" version that will be released once
we get these installer built).

We are currently targeting the following platforms:

* Windows 10 / Windows 11 (64-bit only)
* macOS 10.14+ (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* Linux (64-bit, lots of distros)

We are targeting Python 3.9. Python 3.10 will definitely not work yet. Python 3.7 and 3.8
could work, but we're not focusing on them yet and might not ever unless we hear from you that
you need one of those Python versions.

Here are the links to the guides we have started so far:
